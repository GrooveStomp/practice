Create a window with XCB and render the contents of a pixel buffer.  The pixmap
is a 100x100px image.  It starts black and every 500 microseconds a new pixel is
painted white, starting in the top-left corner and moving horizontally then
vertically to the lower right corner.  This is a demo to find the most minimal
way to create a window an in-memory pixel buffer on Linux systems running X
Windows.
