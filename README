My ongoing collection of daily code practice.
Inspired by Mike Acton at the inaugural HandmadeCon in 2015, these are small, throwaway programs used to hone
my craft.

Because this is intended to be a daily, ongoing thing, this repository is structured according to calendar
dates.  You will find folders named according to year at this level, followed by folders for each month,
followed then by folders for each day.  Each day will be entirely self-contained, but I will copy the
descriptive text into a README in the root folder for each month.  The structure looks like this:
