Binary Insertion Tree in C.
This is an implementation of a Binary insertion tree that uses a fixed, contiguous block of memory.
There are several shortcomings so far, including:

- Non-resizable
- Simply returns `false' if insertion fails for any reason

It appears to work so far, so that's awesome!

Requirements:

- gcc
- nemiver (for using the `debug' command)

Setup:

> cd /path/to/project/root
> source env/shell

Building:

> build

Running:

> run

Debugging:
