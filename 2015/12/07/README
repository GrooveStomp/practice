Futzing around with stb_truetype as preparatory work for getting font rendering work in another project.
This took *way* too long to finish.
My intention was for about 30 minutes, but I wound up taking close to 2 hours.

Here is a rough outline of some problems:
- Mixing together SDL + STB_Truetype
- Incomplete knowledge about bitmap pitch
- Unfamiliar with SDL APIs for creating and manipulating streaming textures
- Crashing when trying to use stbtt_FreeBitmap
- A silly bug where I was using `getcwd' without appending the TTF filename
- Nemiver seems to not let me `stop' in any way whatsoever

So there were a few things.  Probably a few more I don't recall as well.
On the good side, I learned some things about Pitch and the SDL Texture APIs that I actually completely
didn't understand before.  This will directly benefit my software renderer.
