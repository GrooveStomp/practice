Bezier curves!
I received two issues of pico-8 zine (http://pico8fanzine.bigcartel.com/) in the mail today. After flipping
through, I felt motivated to create something.  I also figured that Pico8 is sort of an ideal tool for
daily code practice, as it gives such easy access to drawing, input and sound.

Because Pico 8 is a closed proprietary system, I've included the source as a plaintext file.

Requirements:

- Pico 8: http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php

Setup:

Simply put `bezier.p8' into the cart directory for your system:

Windows: C:/Users/Yourname/AppData/Roaming/pico-8/carts
OSX: /Users/Yourname/Library/Application Support/pico-8/carts
Linux: ~/.lexaloffle/pico-8/carts
