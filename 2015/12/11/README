A very small ASM program copied from Wikipedia.

The inspiration for this particular project is a little indirect.
I was actually bereft of ideas for programming tonight due to my severe lack of available time.
I had the fun idea of writing an extremely simple virtual machine, then got stuck on the idea of a simulator
vs. a compiler. That is, dynamically executing incoming instructions, or generating machine output.
While following these thoughts, I remember a previous coworker who would write programs directly in ASM
and apparently decided to take a stab at that.
Along the way I ran into some difficulties, because I have a shell alias:

  alias ld="ls -Alhd"

So trying to execute the command `ld` was most certainly not working as anticipated.
Once that was resolved, the rest was smooth sailing.  Unfortunately, this only left time to just copy an
example from Wikipedia and not do any exploration on my own.

Requirements:

- nasm
- ld

Setup:

> cd /path/to/project/root
