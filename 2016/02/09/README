Assembly language programming.
Finally I implemented a very simple program that calls into a subroutine.

I ran into serious hurdles before because I was relying on output from objdump and didn't realize it wasn't valid assembly.
I heavily leveraged the tutorials here: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/index.htm

Requirements:

- gcc
- nasm (If you actually build a legit assembly file)
- ld (See previous)

Setup:

> cd /path/to/project/root
> source env/shell

Running:

> build
> run

You can disassemble a source C file with:

> disassemble file
