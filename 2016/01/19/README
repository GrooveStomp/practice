The intent of this program is to allow generating footnotes in html.
I decided that I don't like embedded links in my posts on my website,
then did some buggering to get footnotes working the way I wanted.
Turns out that Jekyll and Markdown don't support what I want at all.

I've been meaning to write my own static site generator in C for
a while now, anyway.  This is just the first step there.

Requirements:

- gcc
