Socket programming introduction thanks to Gaffer on Games (http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/sending-and-receiving-packets/)
This is a straight-up copy of the sample code from Glenn Fiedler, with a super light API thrown on top of init and send.
The API is not great and not complete, but it works for what I wanted.

Requirements:

- unixy platform that supports bsd sockets
- gcc

Setup:

> cd /path/to/project/root
> source env/shell

Building:

> build

Running:

> run
