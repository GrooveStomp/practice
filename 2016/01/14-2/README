Signal trapping.
This is a modification from 2016-01-11.
- Implements proper signal trapping in server.c so the socket file cleans up properly.
- Uses stdlib.h in client.c for consistent exit(CODE) implementation.

Requirements:

- unixy platform that supports bsd sockets
- gcc

Setup:

> cd /path/to/project/root
> source env/shell

Building:

> build

Running:

> server & # Runs server
> client   # Runs client

Terminate the server with Ctrl+C
