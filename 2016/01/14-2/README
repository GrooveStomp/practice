IPV4 Networking.
This is an attempt to get non-Unix-Domain sockets working.
Initially I tried getting two separate machines on the same internal network talking with each other. Each machine ran it's corresponding program just fine, but no messages seemed to be getting through.
Afterwards I attempted to get both the client and server running on a single machine again but this fails as it did before - can't bind a socket to an address that's in use.
I'll continue investigating tomorrow and see if I can make any progress.

Requirements:

- unixy platform that supports bsd sockets
- gcc

Setup:

> cd /path/to/project/root
> source env/shell

Building:

> build

Running:

> server & # Runs server
> client   # Runs client

Terminate the server with Ctrl+C
