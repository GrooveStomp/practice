IPV4 Networking - Actually Working!
I did a little research on the way in this morning and realized I was incorrectly binding the client socket.
I removed that and included <arpa/inet.h> so I could directly translate a dotted IP string to network binary; and voila!

Requirements:

- unixy platform that supports bsd sockets
- gcc

Setup:

> cd /path/to/project/root
> source env/shell

Building:

> build

Running:

> server & # Runs server
> client   # Runs client

Terminate the server with Ctrl+C
