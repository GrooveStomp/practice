UDP Virtual Connection

Taken largely from: http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/virtual-connection-over-udp/

This models a virtual connection between 1 client and 1 server only.  No multiple clients business.
If a long enough period of time remains, then the virtual connection is broken.
The first message that is received with the correct protocol ID establishes the connection.

To Do:
- Have the server send messages to the client.
- Have the client filter out messages not from the server.

Requirements:

- unixy platform that supports bsd sockets
- gcc

Setup:

> cd /path/to/project/root
> source env/shell

Building:

> build

Running:

  Server:

  > server

  Client:

  > client
  $ [Client] Enter Server IPV4 address:
  > <Enter IP address in IPV4 dotted form>
  $ [Client] Enter Server Port:
  > <Enter Port>
  $ [Client] Enter your data (Ctrl+d or Ctrl+c to stop):
  > <Enter input>
