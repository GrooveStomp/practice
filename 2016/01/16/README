TO DO:
- Client and Server *must* run on separate machines (because client now needs to bind a socket to listen)
- Server sends response to client after receiving message
- Client filters so only server responses come in

Requirements:

- unixy platform that supports bsd sockets
- gcc

Setup:

> cd /path/to/project/root
> source env/shell

Building:

> build

Running:

> server & # Runs server
> client   # Runs client

Terminate the server with Ctrl+C
