Text Replacement, Part 2.
This program takes a series of key/value pairs followed by text to be operated upon.
For example:

    env/build/run name Robert greeting Bonjour "{{ greeting }}, {{ name }}!"

The result would be:

    > Bonjour, Robert!

The program uses my previous hash map implementation (r:1) but fixes some bugs in that.
The key/value pairs are stored in a hashmap for lookup later.
My previous text replacement implementation (r:2) is also used, also with bug fixes.
The text replacement program simply looks up values in the hashmap and does the replacement.

NOTE: I discovered kdbg(r:3) and really like it so far.  It is far superior to Nemiver as a gdb debugging
frontend.

Requirements:

- gcc
- kdbg

Setup:

> cd /path/to/project/root
> source env/shell

Building:

> build

Running:

> env/build/run [key value]... replacement_text
# eg: env/build/run name Robert greeting Bonjour "{{ greeting }}, {{ name }}!"
