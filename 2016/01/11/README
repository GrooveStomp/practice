Unix Sockets.
I don't know how to clean up the socket file when terminating the server.
The server does a double forever loop and exits out when the signal ctrl+C is sent.
Whenever I figure out how to do signal trapping in C, then I'll fix that.
This project is the result of my investigation to client-server socket communication on a single host.

Requirements:

- unixy platform that supports bsd sockets
- gcc

Setup:

> cd /path/to/project/root
> source env/shell

Building:

> build

Running:

> server & # Runs server
> client   # Runs client

Terminate the server with Ctrl+C
