Direct framebuffer graphics programming!

This is a quick 'n dirty hack job, just throwing together scraps that I could quickly find online.
It does follow reading about framebuffer stuff on and off for a while.
The code is really dirty and expects a resolution of 800x600.

Requirements:

- gcc
- linux
- nemiver (for using the `debug' command)

Setup:

> cd /path/to/project/root
> source env/shell

Building:

> build

Running:

# First switch to a TTY. On LXLE I do: ctrl + alt + F6.
> cd /path/to/project/root
> source env/shell
> run
