Text replacement.
The program is hardcoded to look for "{{ }}".
It's also seeded with two variables: "url" and "label".
For any given text, the string "{{ url }}" will be replaced with the value of the "url" variable and the
string "{{ label }}" will be replaced with the value of the "label" variable.  Again, these are two
hardcoded variables within the program. A proper implementation should use a map for lookup.

Requirements:

- unixy platform that supports bsd sockets
- gcc

Setup:

> cd /path/to/project/root
> source env/shell

Building:

> build

Running:

> env/build/run "<a href=\"{{ url }}\">{{ label }}</a>"
