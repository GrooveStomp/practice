Direct framebuffer graphics programming!

This is a quick 'n dirty hack job, just throwing together scraps that I could quickly find online.
It does follow reading about framebuffer stuff on and off for a while.
The code is really dirty and expects a resolution of 800x600.

Tinkering with the Atari ST. Nothing to show, but I'll recap.
I followed the ASM intro here: http://www.voidbred.com/blog/2014/09/programming-the-atari-st-20-years-later/
Some tinkering with that, but only very minorly.
Grabbed Hisoft's C from here: http://www.atarimania.com/utility-atari-st-hisoft-c_s20885.html
Opened the PDF and implemented "Your first program." Played with the trace functionality and interpreter just briefly.
Realized I need to make a custom keyboard mapping for Hatari + my Kinesis Advantage keyboard.
