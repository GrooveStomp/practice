Textual UI (TUI) programming via Termbox.
I've included the two demos from the Termbox project: 'output.c' and 'keyboard.c'
but my program is named 'main.c'.
Really simple dealio that shows a static string in a message box.
Press 'Esc' key to quit.

- python (To run Waf and build Termbox)
- gcc
- kdbg (If debugging)

Setup:

> source env/shell

Building:

Running:
