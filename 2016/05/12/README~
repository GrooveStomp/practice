I did some configuration with dvtm.
dvtm is an awesome text-mode program for terminals influenced heavily by dwm.
You can get dvtm here: http://www.brain-dump.org/projects/dvtm/
You can get dwm here: http://dwm.suckless.org

Provided here are two patch files.
After you grab dvtm, change to the source directory and apply the patches:

> patch < config.def.h.patch
> patch < dvtm-status.patch

Then build normally.  See the appropriate documentation included with dvtm.

So what did I change?

dvtm provides 5 tags by default labelled 1 through 5.  I haven't adopted the tag
mindset yet, so I renamed the tags into workspaces:

[sys][web][social][blog][code]

I also changed the representation of the current layout.  There are four:

name:    tile | grid | bottom stack | fullscreen
graphic: []=  | +++  | TTT          | [ ]

I change the graphics to:

name:    tile  | grid  | bottom stack | fullscreen
graphic: | |=| | |+++| | |-.-|        | |   |

Debatable, but I like it.  I also added two spaces before and after the graphic
to separate the graphic from the tag names.
