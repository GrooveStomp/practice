Trying out the Myrddin language.
I found Myrddin via the Suckless website, from the 2016 conference:
    http://suckless.org/conferences/2016

These code samples are mostly just copying examples from the Myrddin website:
    https://myrlang.org/

Myrddin looks interesting to me.  No garbage collection and low-level like C,
but with some nice features from functional languatges.
It comes across kind of like Rust, but without throwing lifespans in your face
all the time.

For all the examples, just run: `env/build'.
